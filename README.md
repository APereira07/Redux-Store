In this module, you learned how to manage global state using React’s Context API. The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX.

We’ve provided some guidelines to point you in the right direction in the Getting Started section below.
